<!--
I don't know how long this will be worked on, but hopefully it is to a point where it is usable.

Arch-Linux Specifically

NOTE: I am just recreating it.
I am not currently planning on recreating a CPU & RAM, and manually doing all of the recreation. Its just going to replicate the main system, including:
Commands,
Package Manager,
Kernel,
Packages,
and some games & utilities
