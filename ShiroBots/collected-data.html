    <h1>Collected Data</h1>
    <h2>This is here to show what data we collect on you</h2>

    <p>This is meant to be fully transparent. If you feel like we are saving more data, feel free to search through our
        code too!</p>
    <p>Note : We do not save any information on you, unless you use specific commands, and none of this information will
        be public</p>

    <h2>Shiro</h2>
    <br>

    <h3>UserID</h3>
    <p>We save your UserID to differentiate you from other people</p>
    <p>Any command that saves information saves this, since it is how we name the files</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Birthday</h3>
    <p>We save this for the birthday commands</p>
    <p>Commands that save this data <br>
        /remember-birthday</p>
    <p> Commands that access this data</p>
    <p>/birthday</p>
    <p>/show-info</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Reading data</h3>
    <p>/show-info</p>
    <p>Messages you all of the info we saved on you so far</p>
    <br>
    <p>/birthday</p>
    <p>Its optional to make other people allowed to see your birthday, defaults to private</p>
    <p>Sends the birthday inputed from /remember-birthday</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Bot functions</h2>
    <p>These run every once in a while to check for stuff</p>
    <br>
    <p>The bot checks all of the birthday things, so if it is your birthday it will say happy birthday!</p>
