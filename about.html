    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p style="font-size: large">
      Hello! I am Shirodev (Also sometimes go by puppynuff) and I make discord
      bots, and sometimes dabble in different things too.<br />
      I have been making things like games (Though I never finished one),
      discord bots, and some applications to help me with things on and off for
      a 2 - 3 years now.<br />
      I do have a slight issue of redoing things that have been developed pretty
      far (Perfect example is my discord bots) but it also gives me something to
      do, and I normally try and use new languages!<br />
      I so far have prefer typescript / javascript, but I do like using rust, I
      just haven't had much uses for it so far.<br />
      I mainly like working on backend stuff, since I don't see myself as
      someone who makes the most fancy / helpful stuff.<br />
      I might make a api, but I will need to figure out how to do this on whats
      hosting my website.<br />
      If you want to contact me, there is a github and discord links in the
      topbar, and if you want to see my projects click the projects tag!<br />
      <br />
      Currently, I have no work experience.
