      Hello, I am

    <h1 style="padding-top: -10px; color: lightskyblue">ShiroDev</h1>
    <h2 style="color: grey">I make discord bots, and random applications.</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I work on my discord bots (Shiro and Suzu), and a custom
      language (Not much added yet)<br />
      I don't work for anybody, so everything I do is just for fun. I mainly use
      typescript and javascript.

    <h1>What I am currently working on</h1>
    <hr />
    <h3>This website you are reading!</h3>
    <p>
      This is my first (public) Website! <br />
      I don't normally do frontend design, so this is the best I can do
      currently. At somepoint, I am planning to make this look better.

      <h3>Suzu - Discord bot</h3>
      Suzu is a discord bot that I am developing. Currently it doesn't have
      much, but it will be updated soon!<br />
      Suzu is meant to be a moderation bot, so it can help people who don't want
      any extra commands.

      <h3>Shiro - Discord bot</h3>
      Shiro is another discord bot that I am developing. Its early in
      development, so it doesn't have much.<br />
      Shiro is meant to be a game bot. It will have alot of commands, but if you
      want moderation, get suzu.
